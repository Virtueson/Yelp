This project focuses on leveraging the Yelp dataset to identify good restaurants using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze various features of restaurants—such as ratings, review sentiment, location, cuisine type, and user check-ins—to build a predictive model that can recommend high-quality dining experiences.

Key Steps:
Data Exploration: Analyze the Yelp dataset to understand the distribution of restaurant ratings, popular cuisines, and user review patterns.

Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features such as:

Average rating and review count.

Restaurants feature such as how big it is or if there is a car parking area 

Popularity based on check-in frequency.

Machine Learning Model: Train a model (e.g., regression, classification) to predict restaurant quality based on the engineered features.


Insights: Identify the most influential features that contribute to a restaurant's success and provide actionable recommendations for users.

Outcome:
The project aims to create a data-driven approach to finding good restaurants, helping users make informed dining decisions while providing insights into what makes a restaurant stand out on Yelp.
